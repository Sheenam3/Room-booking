The manifest creates an ensemble of three ZooKeeper servers using a StatefulSet, zk; a Headless Service, zk-hs, to control the domain of the ensemble; a Service, zk-cs, that clients can use to connect to the ready ZooKeeper instances; and a PodDisruptionBugdet, zk-pdb, that allows for one planned disruption. (Note that while this ensemble is suitable for demonstration purposes, it isnâ€™t sized correctly for production use.)
